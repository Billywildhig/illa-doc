## What do we use Google data for?

When you want to connect ILLA Cloud to Google Sheets, we will request access to Google API to retrieve data from your Google Drive and Google Sheets. The specific requests and usage are as follows:

1.  To connect to Google Sheets using OAuth in read and write mode, we will request access to the following three APIs:
    -   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`
    -   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`
    -   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`

ILLA Cloud uses these three APIs for the following purposes:

-   We use `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` to set your Drive access permission to read-only. This allows you and your users to read, create, modify, and delete files when accessing Google Sheets through ILLA Cloud.
-   We use `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` to access your spreadsheets. This enables you and your users to perform read, add, delete, and modify operations on spreadsheet data through ILLA Cloud.
-   We use `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` to list the accessible file names in your Drive. This helps you and your users quickly select the files they want to work with.

2.  To connect to Google Sheets using OAuth in read-only mode, we will request access to the following two APIs:
    -   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`
    -   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly`

ILLA Cloud uses these three APIs for the following purposes:

-   We use `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` to set your Drive access permission to read-only. This allows you and your users to read files and no way to create, modify, and delete files when accessing Google Sheets through ILLA Cloud.
-   We use `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly` to access your spreadsheets. This enables you and your users to read data and no way to add, delete, and modify data in spreadsheet through ILLA Cloud.

We do not store your data, and each time the data is displayed, it is directly fetched and shown to you through the API. Additionally, ILLA does not share your connection to Google data with any third parties through any means.
