# V 4.0

2023.12.07

## 🚀 New features

* Mock data for your actions
  * When the API is not ready yet, you can use Mock data for simulation
* Create app from an AI Agent
  * By clicking `Create app from AI Agent`, we will automatically set up the interface and data connections between components and the AI Agent. You can then configure the necessary functionalities for your business on top of this foundation.
* Actions for SQL databases types such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, etc., now support the ability to set either Safe mode or Unsafe mode.
  * Safe mode: Your SQL can only reference variables in the place of variables, for example, `where name = '{{input1.value}}'`. This prevents users from compromising your database by inputting statements like `'; drop table;'` in input1
  * Unsafe mode: When using the unsafe mode, SQL syntax words can also be replaced with variables, such as `where {{input1.value}} {{input2.value}} '{{input3.value}}'`. However, in this case, the database can be compromised by the content entered by the user. It is not recommended for you to use this mode.

## 🐛 Bug fix

* Fixed an issue where the Data Grid component would throw an error in certain cases when switching the primary key.
