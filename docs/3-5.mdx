## 💅 Polish

* Optimizations for the image component
  * Supports setting automatic height or fixed height.
  * When set to automatic height, you can specify the image aspect ratio, and the height will be calculated automatically based on the fixed ratio.
  * You can change the shape of the component by setting a radius. For example, setting the radius to 50% when the image ratio is `{{1}}` will display the image in a circular shape.
